in order to run the script, within the command line you will need to create the virtual environment and install the required packages. setup.sh does this for you

after that is successful, please run **jam_city_demo.py**  **excel file we wish to translate**, note that it is important to have an "English" column to translate. After translation is complete into all reqeusted languages (see constants.py) it will create a file that is identical to the input file with the translated languages added.

### files:
* jam_city_demo.py: the main file which runs the demo
* setup.sh: the setup bash script
* translation_API.py: the translation object
* constants.py: constants which the rest of the project uses
